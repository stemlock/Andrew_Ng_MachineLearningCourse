# Recreation of the Weekly Assignments from the Andrew Ng Machine Learning Course
My personal recreations of the Andrew Ng Machine Learning weekly assignments in Python from scratch (no external machine learning libraries were used).

### Algorithms Implemented from Scratch

- [Linear Regression](Week2_LinearRegression/Programming Exercise 1 - Linear Regression.ipynb)
- [Logistic Regression](Week3_LogisticRegression/)
- [Multi-class Logistic Regression](Week4_NeuralNetworks/)
- [Neural Networks - Forward Propagation](Week4_NeuralNetworks/)
